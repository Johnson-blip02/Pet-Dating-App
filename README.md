**Pet Dating App**

A full-stack web application where users can create pet profiles, like other pets, and chat in real-time. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, .NET/Express, MongoDB, WebSockets, and Cloudinary.
Deployed using Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)

Our project reimagines networking through the lens of pets, blending social connection, profile discovery, and real-time communication into a fun and engaging platform. Much like human social networking apps, users create detailed profiles for their pets, explore others based on shared interests or preferences, and connect through a mutual matching system. Once a match is formed, they can chat in real time via WebSockets, promoting interaction and playful bonding.

🐾 Pet-First Social Networking: Users create detailed pet profiles including age, type, location, preferences, and photos — turning the networking experience into a lighthearted yet functional platform.

📸 Image Upload with Cloudinary Integration: Profile images are uploaded and hosted in the cloud with real-time preview and validation.

💬 Real-Time Chat via WebSockets: Matched pet profiles can instantly start chatting using a scalable WebSocket-based messaging system — emulating real-time communication apps.

🧠 Like/Match Logic: Pets can “like” each other, and a chat only opens when both users have liked one another — creating meaningful interactions.

🛠 Admin Tools for Moderation: Admins can view, update, and delete user profiles, ensuring responsible use of the platform.

🌗 Responsive UI with Light/Dark Mode: Built with Tailwind CSS, the app adapts to user preferences and works across all device sizes.
